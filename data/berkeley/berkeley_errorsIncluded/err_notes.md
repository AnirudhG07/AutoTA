# Alg 1.1

removed the restriction n>3. r>s>0 does not follow. also removed "except 1" from the third-last line. incomplete solution.

# Alg 1.2

Changed "the only integer in 1,2,...,n divisible by..." to "the only positive real number less than n divisible by...".
Changes "for some integers j, k" to "for some real numbers j, k".
Changed "odd and even" to not use odd and even terminologies to avoid indirectly referencing to integers.
Not sure if this is a significant change.

# Alg 2.1

changed "r-tuples" to "all possible sets (unordered pairs) of size r" and still concluded the next step.

# Alg 2.2

Missing the cases j=0 and j=k_j
this changes the expression of d(n) to (k_1 -1)(k_2 -1)...(k_n -1)
You still get the right answer but the method is wrong.

# LinAlg 1.1

for 1, we start with assuming what we need to prove.
2 -- a lot of mistakes, just wrong argument overall
3 -- removed the sentence "S is injective, and therefore, S^-1 is well defined, making it an incomplete arguemnt."

# LinAlg 2.1

changed "m>n" to "m != n"
changed "by rank nullity theorem" to "spectral theorem"
changed ">" to ">=" in a couple places
no major-major changes.

# LinAlg 2.2

1. the dimensions of the matrix in the domain of T1 and T2 are wrong.
2. the definitions of T1 and T2 in the second paragraph are not the same definitions as in the first paragraph. we essentially interchange m and n in the second paragraph. removed the newer definitions of T1 and T2 from the second paragraph -- used completely new functions without defining them
