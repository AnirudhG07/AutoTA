## Theorem:
 Prove that the series \( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n} \frac{(n+1)^{32}}{n!} \) is convergent


## Proof:
Certainly! Here is a clean and structured version of the mathematical proof:

First, consider the ratio of consecutive terms in the sequence, denoted as $\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$. We have:

\[
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{(n+2)^{32} \cdot n!}{(n+1)! \cdot (n+1)^{32}}
\]

This simplifies to the expression:

\[
\left(\frac{n+2}{n+1}\right)^{32} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1}
\]

We now analyze the behavior of this expression for values of $n \geq 2$. The fraction $\left(\frac{n+2}{n+1}\right)^{32}$ can be expanded to:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{32}
\]

Since for $n \geq 2$, the term $\frac{1}{n+1}$ is positive but decreasing, the expression $\left(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{32}$ remains slightly greater than 1, but is dampened by the factor of $\frac{1}{n+1}$ multiplied with it.

Thus, for $n \geq 2$, $\frac{1}{n+1} < 1$, and consequently:

\[
\left(\frac{n+2}{n+1}\right)^{32} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} < 1
\]

Hence, for $n \geq 2$, the sequence is decreasing.

Finally, by applying the Alternating Series Test, we conclude that the sequence is convergent.
