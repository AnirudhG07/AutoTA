A fundamental invariant of a stable generalized complex structure (M, ùìò) is its type, defined by Type(ùìò) = deg(\\Omega) = k, as in [10, Section 3.1]. In dimension 4, the possible constant types are k ‚àà {0, 1, 2}. The value k = 0 corresponds to a stable generalized complex structure induced by a symplectic structure, while k = 2 corresponds to one induced by a complex structure. Stable generalized complex structures of type k = 1 have been studied by Bailey‚ÄìCavalcanti‚ÄìGualtieri [1] and Chen‚ÄìNie [6]."
