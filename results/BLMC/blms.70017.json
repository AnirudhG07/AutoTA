      "abstract": "Webb’s conjecture states that the orbit space of the Brown complex of a finite group at any given prime $\\ell$ is contractible. This conjecture was proved by Symonds in 1998. In this paper, we suggest a generalisation of Webb’s conjecture for finite reductive groups. This is done by associating to each irreducible character a new simplicial complex defined in terms of Deligne–Lusztig theory. We then show that our conjecture follows from a condition, called $(e\\text{-HC-conj})$ below, related to generalised Harish-Chandra theory. In particular, using earlier results of the author, we prove our conjecture and recover Symonds result for finite reductive groups under mild restrictions on the prime $\\ell$. Finally, we show that the condition $(e\\text{-HC-conj})$ is implied by the contractibility of the orbit spaces associated to our newly defined complex offering an unexplored topological approach to proving the uniqueness of $e$-cuspidal pairs up to conjugation."

Its study was initiated by Brown [6] while its importance in the study of finite group theory was highlighted by the work of Quillen [25]. Here, we are interested in a statement that was first conjectured by Webb. For this observe that $G$ has a natural action on the poset $\\mathcal{S}^*_\\ell(G)$ induced by conjugation that endows $\\Delta(\\mathcal{S}^*_\\ell(G))$ with a structure of a $G$-simplicial complex. Webb conjectured in [33] that the associated orbit space $\\Delta(\\mathcal{S}^*_\\ell(G))/G$ is contractible and proved in [34] that it is always mod $\\ell$ acyclic. Webb’s conjecture was fully proved by Symonds [32] and later extended to orbit spaces of fusion systems by Linckelmann [21]."

This partition has applications to several problems: from the parametrisation of the Brauer $\\ell$-blocks in non-defining characteristic (see [5, 8, 9] and [19]), to the study of the long-standing local-global conjectures (see [11, 12, 14, 18, 23, 26, 28] and [30]), to even the study of the representations of $p$-adic groups (see [20]).

Morse theoretic techniques have been successfully exploited to obtain results on the contractibility of orbit spaces for subgroup complexes. In [7], Bux used discrete Morse theory, as developed by Bestvina and Brady [2], to obtain a new proof of Webb’s conjecture on the contractibility of the orbit space of the $\\ell$-subgroups complex. Recently, another proof of Webb’s conjecture was given by Steinberg [31] utilising, instead, the discrete Morse theory of Forman [15]. We also mention Grodal’s result [17, Proposition A.3], where Webb’s conjecture is proved by removing (or pruning) a conjugacy class of $\\ell$-subgroups at a time. In this paper, we make use of discrete Morse theory by applying a criterion obtain by Bux in [7]."
