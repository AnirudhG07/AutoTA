We prove that the minimal period of such a tiling is bounded by $\\exp(c (\\log D)^2 / \\log \\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of $A$. In the converse direction, given $\\epsilon > 0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2 - \\epsilon}$.

This bound was subsequently improved by Kolountzakis [6], Ruzsa [23, Appendix] and Biró [1].

Indeed, if $|A|$ has 3 or more distinct prime factors, examples exist where $\\Phi_M \\mid A$ but $A$ does not contain any ‘fibers’ (cosets of sub-lattices), causing $\\mathrm{diam}(A)$ to be far smaller than $M/2$."
