For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 3

- Yes
- No
- No

The model wants the solution for a general `x` in (0, 1) however providing a counterexample should suffice.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Prove that $F(x)$ is not differentiable at a general $x \\in (0,1)$."
    }
  ]
```

Here are others error statements provided by the model -

```json
    "errors": [
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "$F(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \\, dt = \\frac{x^2}{2}$",
        "errors": [
          "The integral $F(x)$ might not be $\\frac{x^2}{2}$ for the non-continuous function $f$ as given."
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
"claim": "We have $f(\\frac{1}{4}) = 1$, but from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $f(\\frac{1}{4})$ should be $F'(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
        "errors": [
          "Misapplication of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; $f$ not continuous at $1/4$ means $F$ is not necessarily differentiable there."
        ]
      }
    ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 3

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
{
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "$F'(t) = f(t)$",
        "proof-method": "Fundamental theorem of calculus",
        "errors": [
          "The function $f$ being Riemann integrable does not necessarily imply that $F$ is differentiable everywhere on $(0,1)$. $f$ must also be continuous."
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "$f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$",
        "errors": [
          "$f$ is given as Riemann integrable, not necessarily continuous."
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "$F$ is differentiable on $(0,1)$ because $f$ is continuous",
        "errors": [
          "The proof incorrectly assumes $f$ is continuous, which is not given."
        ]
      }
```

## 22120 | Problem 3

- No

Many places the model has taken `x` as `n`. This influences other results in the proof such as `x^2/2` being written as `nx` or `nx^2/2`. Here are examples for the mentioned case -

```markdown
As $n$ and $1$ are continuous functions,
...

- $nx$ and $x$ are primitives of $n$ and $1$ respectively.
- $\int_{0}^{x} f(t) dt = \frac{nx^{2}}{2} \quad \forall x \in [0, \frac{1}{2}]$
```

- No
- No

Comments: Due to the presence of `n` in the proof, the proof itself is wrong and thus so feedback is not correct w.r.t. expected one. However considering `n` being present as proof, the error finding it correct except for the fact the model does not count `counterexample` based proofs as "complete", as highlighted above.

```json
"errors": [
          "The final claim is incorrect for the general case of $f$ being Riemann integrable. The proof only shows differentiability at $x=1/2$ for a specific function."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "errors": [
    "The proof does not cover the general case, only a specific example."
  ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 3

- Yes
- No
- No

```json
{
              "type": "assert",
              "claim": "Thus, $1 = |(1 + L) - (L - 1)| \\leq |1 + L| + |1 - L| \\leq \\epsilon + \\epsilon = 2\\epsilon = 1$, leading to $1 < 1$, a contradiction.",
              "errors": [
                {
                  "description": "Misinterpretation in the final argument leading to contradiction."
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "type": "conclude",
              "statement": "$\\lim_{x \\to \\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{F(x) - F(\\frac{1}{2})}{x - \\frac{1}{2}}$ does not exist.",
              "errors": [
                {
                  "description": "The proof contains errors and is incomplete."
                }
              ]
            },
```

These are wrong since the statements by student is correct(the professor also has marked it correct). These errors are clearly incomplete, simply leaving them as "proof contains errors" is not helpful. Also the `Misterpretation` error is wrong since the statement is correct.

## 22211 | Problem 3

- Yes
- No
- No

The model does not consider `counterexample` based proofs.

```json
"errors": [
      "The counterexample used to disprove the statement only shows non-differentiability at $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, not for all $x \\in (0,1)$."
    ]
```
