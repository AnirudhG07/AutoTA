# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 10

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
    "errors": [
      "The steps between asserting that $\\text{dim}(\\text{null } T)$ is finite and concluding $\\text{dim}(V)$ is finite via the Rank-Nullity Theorem are not fully justified. Specifically, the proof does not correctly show that $V$ is finite-dimensional based on the given assumptions."
    ]
  },
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify each step in detail, proving that $V$ must be finite-dimensional given that $\\text{null}(T)$ is finite-dimensional and $T: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$"
    }

```

## 22097 | Problem 10

- Yes
- No
- Yes

For this proof, the student didn't write anything. The model doesn't halucinate and mention the missing proof statement.

```json
"missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "Statement": "Show that the dimension of \\( V \\) is finite given that the null space of \\( T \\) is finite-dimensional and \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is 1-dimensional as a vector space over \\( \\mathbb{R} \\)"
    }
  ]
```

## 22120 | Problem 10

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"errors": [
          "The proof that \\( N(T) \\) would be infinite dimensional if \\( V \\) were infinite dimensional is not justified."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify why \\( N(T) \\) would be infinite dimensional if \\( V \\) were infinite dimensional."
    }
  ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 10

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "Statement": "Proper justification for the case when \\( \\dim(R(T)) = 1 \\).",
      "Solved": false
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "Statement": "Proper application of the Rank-Nullity Theorem.",
      "Solved": false
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    "Incorrect handling of arbitrary vectors and field properties in Case 2.",
    "Assumption that \\( V \\) is finite-dimensional not properly justified."
  ]
```

## 22183 | Problem 10

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"errors": [
      {
        "type": "problem",
        "statement": "Incorrect assumption that $\\text{Range}(T) = \\mathbb{R}$ without proof",
        "solved": false
      }
    ]
```

## 22211 | Problem 10

- Yes

Remarks: The proof is correct and was able to understand the proof when the page was divided into two parts for cases 1 and 2.

- No

The structured proof is not well generated and contains many empty blocks with simply telling statement its main type without further explanation.

- Yes

The proof is correct yet the model wants more rigorous justifications. The mentioned are not wrong, though extra details are not needed.

```json
          "errors": [
            "The proof contains notation inconsistencies and some steps are informal or unclear.",
            "Some steps are not rigorously justified, and there are gaps in establishing the finite-dimensionality formally."
          ]

  },
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Provide rigorous justification for each step in Case 2."
    }
  ]
```
