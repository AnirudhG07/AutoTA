# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

Dataset: UMA101 Finals 2023 Main

Git Commits | Repo Name: 68afd8cb, d4214bd8, 14a9c27e | LeanAide

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

# 22067 | Problem 5

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "A precise relationship between $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ must be established."
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    "Several steps in the proof are missing or incomplete, particularly the detailed $\\epsilon-\\delta$ argument.",
    "There are logical inconsistencies in the use of absolute values and inequalities."
  ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 5

- Yes
- Yes

The student has left the answer blank yet there exists proof statements, which is a clear indication of hallucination.

- No
  Since no proof has been written by the student, any errors detected is just the model giving pointless feedback to itself.

## 22120 | Problem 5

- No

The model took the overwritten 7/6 -> 7/4 as 7/8. Later on whenever the student clearly writes 7/4, the model interprets it as 7/8 to maintain consistency.

```latex

$\frac{7}{8} = (\frac{1}{8})^{2/3} + (\frac{1}{8})^{1/3} + 1 < n^{2/3} + n^{1/3} + 1$ $\implies$ $\frac{1}{n^{2/3} + n^{1/3} + 1} < \frac{8}{7}$ $\implies$ $\frac{1}{n^{2/3} + n^{1/3} + 1} < \frac{8}{7}$
```

- No
- No

The use of 7/8 instead of 7/4 messed up the errors. However the errors seem valid based on 7/8 atleast.
We could relax the rigour here since providing justification of $\delta$ and bounds on $n$ may not be a strict requirement.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Provide a correct justification for the choice of $\\delta$ and the bounds on $n$."
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Prove the inequality $\\frac{|n - 1|}{|n^{2/3} + n^{1/3} + 1|} < \\epsilon$ correctly."
    }
```

## 22172 | Problem 5

- No

The model is not interpretting the fractions correctly. The numbers are clearly written yet we see random mixed up fractions in inequalities. Any anomalies in the beginning stage introduces more errors in the later part of the proof.

```latex
Let $\epsilon > 0$. Then $\frac{7}{3} \epsilon \delta > 0$
```

Here it is 7/4 instead of 7/3, which is very clear in the image.

- No
- No

Due to wrong fractions present in the proof, we see a lot of errors. However the errors themselves are fine, considering the mistakes.

```json
  "errors": [
    "The proof has multiple steps with unjustified assertions and incorrect relations.",
    "The connection between $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ is not properly established.",
    "Several bounding steps lack appropriate justification."
  ]
```

## 22183 | Problem 5

- Yes
- No
- No

The errors are not highlighted here much as one would expect based on previous problems. Only `missing` statements are provided however the solution is completely wrong and `errors` should have been present.

```json
"missing": [
          {
            "type": "problem",
            "statement": "Prove that $(δ + 1)^{\\frac{1}{3}} - 1 \\leq \\epsilon$ using the choice of $δ$."
          }
]
```

## 22211 | Problem 5

- No

The model has misterpreted the fractions in the proof. Instead of `1/3`, it has taken `3` which completely changes the problem.

- No
- No

The model has one of the errros -

```json
        "errors": [
          "Undefined symbol $\\delta_r$ and insufficient justification."
        ]
```

However in the proof, $\delta_r$ is clearly defined as `$\delta = \max \{\epsilon, 1\}$` which is a valid definition.

The errors are less descriptive and more of a general feedback.

```json
        "errors": [
          "Depends on the previous incorrect assertions."
        ]
        "errors": [
          "Conclusion relies on incorrect previous steps."
        ]
```

Other feedbacks given are -

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Correct manipulation of the inequality involving $|x^3 - 1|$."
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Proper definition and use of the symbol $\\delta_r$."
    }
  ]
```
