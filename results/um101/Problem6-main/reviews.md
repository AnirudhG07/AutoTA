# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

Dataset: UMA102 Finals 2023 Main

Git Commits | Repo Name: 68afd8cb, d4214bd8, 14a9c27e | LeanAide

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
- `D`: Any other comments? (Leave empty if none)
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 6

- Yes
- No
- No

The model is asking for missing steps in the proof, which are not mentioned by the student in the proof nor is required since the task for only to prove series is convergent.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify why $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(\\sin(\\frac{1}{n}))^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 0$.",
      "solved": false
    },
```

The model also asks justification for obvious facts like -

```json
{
  "type": "problem",
  "statement": "Justify the assumption $0 < \\sin(\\frac{1}{n}) < \\frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \\geq 0$.",
  "solved": false
}
```

## 22097 | Problem 6

- Yes
- Yes

The student has written nothing yet we see model writing his own proof and giving feedback, which is clear hallucination.

- No

Since the student has not written anything, any feedback on errors or missing steps is not valid.

## 22120 | Problem 6

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "statement": "Prove that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(\\sin \\frac{1}{n})^{3/2}$ converges using a suitable convergence test or criterion."
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "statement": "The proof does not establish the convergence of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(\\sin \\frac{1}{n})^{3/2}$, it only shows that the terms of the series tend to zero."
    }
```

## 22172 | Problem 6

- Yes
- No
- Yes

The model is asking justification for obvious facts like -

```json
        "missing": [
          {
            "type": "problem",
            "statement": "Justify the step that $0 < \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{1}{n})}{\\frac{1}{n}} < 1$ implies $0 < \\sin(\\frac{1}{n}) < \\frac{1}{n}$"
          }
        ]
```

## 22183 | Problem 6

- Yes

Comments: The student had written proof by dividing the page but the model correctly identified the order and gave a clean latex generation.

- No
- Yes

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Complete the convergence proof for the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\sin \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{3 / 2}$"
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "statement": "Proof is missing critical steps to establish the convergence of the series."
    }
  ]
```

## 22111 | Problem 6

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify why the comparison test applies directly to $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\sin(\\frac{1}{n})^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ and $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$."
    }
```
