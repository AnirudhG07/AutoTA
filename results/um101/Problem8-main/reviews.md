# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

Dataset: UMA101 Finals 2023 Main

Git Commits | Repo Name: 68afd8cb, d4214bd8, 14a9c27e | LeanAide

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 8

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
    "errors": [
      "The statement to be proven is \\( f(x) < g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\geq 0 \\), but the proof shows \\( f(x) \\leq g(x) \\)."
    ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 8

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
  "errors": [
    "The proof incorrectly assumes that f(c) > g(c) implies f'(c) > g'(c).",
    "The proof does not correctly utilize the given conditions."
  ]
```

## 22120 | Problem 8

- No

The model didn't count out the the scratched out part of the proof. It read that and adds to the proof too. Maybe the picture should take care of this issue.

- No
- No

The model wasn't able to point out a missing statement that the professor has written remarks. The student had to prove within the problem that `f(x)<= g(x)`, which he directly wrote, which the model didn't point out.

```json
  "errors": [
    "The proof concludes f(x) \\le g(x) instead of f(x) < g(x). The strict inequality is not justified by the given argument."
  ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 8

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "assert",
      "claim": "g^{\\prime}(c) \\geq f^{\\prime}(c) for all c \\in \\mathbb{R} is incorrectly inferred"
    },
    {
      "type": "assert",
      "claim": "g(x) \\geq f(x) does not imply f(x) < g(x)"
    }
  ]
```

## 22183 | Problem 8

- Yes
- No
- No

The student proof is correctly except for the fact he has not specified the domain of `$x` in the proof properly. The model didn't point out this error.

```json
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "statement": "The proof does not conclude $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x \\geq 0$ but only shows $f(a) \\leq g(a)$."
    }
  ]
```

## 22211 | Problem 8

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"missing": [
    {
            "statement": "A correct justification that h(x) cannot be negative for any x > 0, possibly involving a different approach or additional assumptions."
    }
]
```
