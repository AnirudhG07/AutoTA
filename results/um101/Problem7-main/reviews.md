# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

Dataset: UMA102 Finals 2023 Main

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
- `D`: Any other comments? (Leave empty if none)
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 7

- Yes
- No
- No

The student proof is correct, although not neatly written. But the model expects a much more rigourous solution. The error is not enough descriptive as to why the proof is wrong.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Verify the absolute convergence of $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(n+1)^{32}}{n!}$ rigorously."
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    "Incorrect conclusion that $a_n$ converges absolutely from the limit calculation."
  ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 7

- Yes
- No
- Yes

The student has not written anything and the model correctly identifies the missing part of the proof, which in this case is the whole solution.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "statement": "Show that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n} \\frac{(n+1)^{32}}{n!}$ satisfies the criteria for an alternating series test or use a different convergence test."
    }
  ]
```

## 22120 | Problem 7

- Yes
- No
- No

The model is expecting a more detailed proof, but the student's proof is correct.

```json
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify that the ratio test is applicable to $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |b_n|$"
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Complete the verification that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{32} = 1$ explicitly"
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "assert",
      "statement": "In evaluating $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n}$, ensure proper handling of factorial terms and limits."
    }
  ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 7

- Yes
- No
- No

The errors are non-descriptive and wrongly presented.

```json
    "errors": [
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "\\sum \\frac{(-1)^n (n+1)^{32}}{n!} converges absolutely"
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "Absolute convergence implies conditional convergence"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## 22183 | Problem 7

- Yes
- No
- No

The proof is completely wrong yet the model does not find any errors in the solution. The missing statements are correctly identified though.

```json
"missing": [
          {
            "statement": "Prove that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(n+2)^{32}}{(n+1)^{32} (n+1)} = 0$."
          },
          {
            "statement": "Prove that $\\frac{(n+2)^{32}}{(n+1)^{32} (n+1)}$ is decreasing."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "errors": []
  }
```

## 22111 | Problem 7

- No

The student has used `(n+2)!` multiple times in the proof yet the model has not used it anywhere in the latex generation. It has consistently only used either `n!` or `(n+1)!`.

- No
- Yes

Here the model has caught the error in the latex generation in the first step and is commenting on the series to be different.

```json
        "errors": [
          "The series considered in the proof, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n (n!)^{32}}{n!}$, does not match the series in the theorem statement.",
          "The expression $\\frac{(n!)^{32}}{(n+1)!}$ is incorrect; it should be $\\frac{(n+1)^{32}}{(n+1)!}$."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "errors": [
    "The proof considers the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n (n!)^{32}}{n!}$ instead of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n (n+1)^{32}}{n!}$. This is a different series.",
    "The steps involving factorials are incorrect for the given series."
  ]
```
