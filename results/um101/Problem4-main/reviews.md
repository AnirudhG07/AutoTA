For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
- `D`: Any other comments? (Leave empty if none)
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 4

- Almost Yes
  To clean up the latex, since student's proof is not clean, many of the statements are made by him, though they are not unreasonable. However the model nowhere used `{}` to denote sequences.

- No
- Yes

```json
"errors": [
          "Incorrectly assumes {2x_ny_n}_{n ‚àà ‚Ñï} is necessarily convergent"
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "conclude",
        "statement": "W is a vector subspace of ùíÆ",
        "errors": [
          "Incorrect conclusion based on invalid assumption about {2x_ny_n}_{n ‚àà ‚Ñï}."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "errors": [
    "The proof incorrectly assumes that the product of two convergent sequences is always convergent. This is not necessarily true."
  ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 4

- Yes
- Yes

The student has left the answer blank yet there exists proof statements, which is a clear indication of hallucination.

- No
  Since no proof has been written by the student, any errors detected is just the model giving pointless feedback to itself.

## 22120 | Problem 4

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"errors": [
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "we cannot say anything about the convergence of \\( \\sum u_n w_n \\)",
        "errors": [
          "This claim is not justified. For \\( u, w \\in W \\), the convergence of \\( \\sum u_n w_n \\) should be examined more rigorously."
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "\\sum u_n^2 + w_n^2 \\text{ is convergent}",
        "errors": [
          "This claim needs more justification. The convergence of \\( \\sum u_n^2 + \\sum w_n^2 \\) does not imply the convergence of their sum without proper handling of cross terms."
        ]
      }
    ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 4

- Yes
- No
- No

The model is expecting rigourous proof for each and every step in the proof, even for results which are obvious and trivial. Saying `4<2` being a contradiction has logical errors, does not make sense and the model showed specify more on what we expects/what is wrong. However most of these errors hopefully be rectified after `truly_missin` second pass.

## 22183 | Problem 4

- No
  The model is not able to identify marked statements as `- (1)`, etc.

```latex
Scalar multiplication follows the closure property.
From $\oplus, \odot, \otimes$, $W$ is a subspace.
```

There is no such statements with `$\oplus, \odot, \otimes$` in the student's proof. Rather the previous line mentioned in example is marked `- (3)` which is not identified by the model.

- No
- Yes

The latex code not being good resulted in some misinterpreted errors, yet the errors present are itself very GOOD.

        "claim": "\\{\\{c a_n\\}\\} \\implies \\{c^2 a_n^2\\} \\in W",
