# Reviews of Generations

This is style of reviews for the generated structured proofs pipeline. Please mention the Dataset Name and all Git Commit of Dataset Run(to keep track of updates).

For each problem, the review contains the following information with Yes/No and any comments below it.

```markdown
## {Student ID} | Problem {ID}

- `A`: Is the Latex generation correct and clean?
- `B`: Does the structured proof generation contain noticable halucinations?
- `C`: Are the missing and error statements correctly identified?
```

> Noticable halucinations are the ones that are not present in the original proof and are not trivially derivable from the original proof.

## 22067 | Problem 9

- Yes
- No
- No

The structured proof is not well generated. It has simply written about statement in proof, and not commented on proof-method, intermediate types, etc.

```json
        "missing": [
          {
            "type": "problem",
            "statement": "Complete proof for the lower bound $M \\le \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}(\\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)|^n \\, dx)^{1/n}$"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "errors": [
      "Incorrect intermediate steps involving $Mn \\ge |f(x)|^n$ were not properly justified."
    ]
```

## 22097 | Problem 9

- Yes
- Yes

The student proof is empty yet we see proof statements generated by the model, which is clearly indication of halucination.

- No

Since the proof is empty, the feedbacks given has no significance and pointless.

## 22120 | Problem 9

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
    "errors": [
      "The proof only shows an upper bound and does not establish the lower bound or the actual limit."
    ]
  },
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Show that $(\\int_{0}^{1} f(x)^{n} d x)^{1 / n}$ is also bounded below by $M$."
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Show that the limit is indeed equal to $M$."
    }
  ]
```

## 22172 | Problem 9

- Yes
- No
- Yes

However, the error statements are less descriptive than expected.

```json
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "claim": "\\{(\\int_0^1 (f(x))^n dx)^{1/n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\text{ is an increasing sequence}",
        "errors": [
          "Not proved"
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "conclude",
        "statement": "\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (\\int_0^1 (f(x))^n dx)^{1/n} = M",
        "missing": [
          {
            "type": "problem",
            "statement": "Prove that \\{ (\\int_0^1 (f(x))^n dx)^{1/n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} is an increasing sequence."
          }
        ]
      }
```

## 22183 | Problem 9

- Yes
- No
- Yes

```json
"missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Show that $\\left( \\int_{0}^{1} f(x)^2 \\,dx \\right)^{1/n}$ approaches $M$ as $n$ approaches infinity."
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Justify the steps involving $(-M)^n$ and $\\left( (f(x_1)^2)^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\right)^{1/n}$."
    },
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Clarify the step involving $(-1)^n (1-0)$."
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    "Incorrect inequality involving $(-M)^n$ and $(-f(x_1))^n$."
  ]
```

## 22211 | Problem 9

- No

The model has incorrectly identified the exponent as `h` instead of `1/n`

```latex
- $\lim\limits_{h \to \infty} (\int\limits_0^1 (f(x))^n dx)^h \leq M$
```

- No
- Yes

```json
        "errors": [
          "Step not justified. The equality with 1 is not properly justified or explained."
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "missing": [
    {
      "type": "problem",
      "statement": "Prove the bound from below to show that the limit is precisely M."
    }
```
