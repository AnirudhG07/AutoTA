## Rubric for Grading Proof Errors (Severity: 1â€“5)

**1. Minor Formal Errors (Score: 1)**

- Notation/terminology issues without affecting logic.
- Examples: Mislabeling variables, missing definitions, or minor imprecision.

**2. Incomplete Details (Score: 2)**

- Missing obvious steps or intermediate details.
- Examples: Skipping base cases, omitting domains, or straightforward simplifications.

**3. Logical Oversights (Score: 3)**

- Missing important considerations but proof is mostly valid.
- Examples: Ignoring edge cases, unproven minor lemmas, or weak case handling.

**4. Substantial Flaws (Score: 4)**

- Incorrect logic or invalid steps undermining the proof.
- Examples: Using wrong theorems, circular reasoning, or overlooking critical conditions.

**5. Critical Errors (Score: 5)**

- Flaws that fully invalidate the proof or its conclusion.
- Examples: Proving the wrong statement, misinterpreting the problem, or contradictory logic.

NOTE: If you feel like giving decimal scores, you can go up to 1 decimal point.
