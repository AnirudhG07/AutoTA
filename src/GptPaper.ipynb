Despite this original motivation, this theorem is nowadays used as an essential tool for proving numerous positive results in combinatorial set theory. Foreman and Todorčević deepened the study of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and introduced variations of the concept of internal approachability, which considers the internal composition of elementary submodels [4]. We are left with a situation in which the formal construction of sets gives rise to its own sort of geometry in which subtle distinctions can be made regarding the structure of such models.\"\n",

He showed that these distinctions can be obtained using mixed-support iterations, which resemble the forcings Mitchell used to obtain the tree property at double successor cardinals. Notable developments in the study of the tree property pertain to obtaining the tree property simultaneously on long intervals of cardinals, and this area of research requires analyses of variants of Mitchell’s forcing. In this spirit, Krueger raised the question of whether these properties could be separated for successive cardinals, or even an infinite sequence of cardinals [12]. We studied the case in which internally stationary is distinguished from internally club by using forcings that accomplish the work of mixed support iterations while more explicitly resembling Mitchell’s forcing [7, 13].\"\n",
